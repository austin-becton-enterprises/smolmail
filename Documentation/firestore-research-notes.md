# Firestore Setup & Research Notes
---

## What is Firestore?

Firestore is a **NoSQL, document-based database** by Google that's part of Firebase and also available on Google Cloud. It stores data in **collections of documents**, which are structured like JSON objects.

It's designed for:
- Real-time apps
- Serverless environments
- Web/mobile/backend integrations
- Scalability without much infrastructure management

## Why Firestore for Our Project?

Since we’re already using Google services (Gmail API, OAuth, etc.), Firestore integrates seamlessly with the existing stack. It supports Python, offers a generous free tier, and simplifies cloud database setup without needing to manage a traditional SQL server.

## Should We Create a New GCP Project for Firestore?

Yes — **for the purpose of testing and mimicking a real client setup**, we are creating a **new Google Cloud project specifically for Firestore**. This simulates the scenario where a potential client provides their own GCP project and database.

However, the key point is:

> **Our code must be written to support multiple GCP projects** — it should be flexible enough to work with any service account and credentials provided by a client, not just our own static project.

## 🛠️ Setup Steps (Using a New GCP Project)

1. Go to: [https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)  
2. Create a **new** GCP project  
3. Search for “Firestore” in the left-hand menu  
4. Click **“Create database”**  
   - Choose **Test mode** or **Production mode**  
   - Select a region (e.g., `us-central1`)  
5. Create a **new service account** in that project with Firestore access  
6. Download the `credentials.json` file and test using the Firestore Python SDK  

This setup helps us simulate how a client might bring their own GCP project and ensures our system is flexible and portable.
